#🕵️‍♂️ Credit Card Fraud Detection – Hackathon Project

This project was created as part of a Data Science Hackathon to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world financial data. The main objective was to explore, preprocess, and model data in order to build an effective fraud detection system.

🎯 Project Goals
	•	Analyze the “Credit Card Fraud Detection” dataset
	•	Identify patterns and key features separating fraudulent and legitimate transactions
	•	Develop and evaluate machine learning models to classify fraud accurately
	•	Share business recommendations to reduce risk and improve detection

💡 Project Focus

We focused on classic fraud analytics tasks, including:
	•	Understanding the data distribution (class imbalance, feature analysis)
	•	Handling imbalanced classes (using SMOTE and resampling techniques)
	•	Feature selection and scaling
	•	Model benchmarking and selection (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
	•	Evaluating model performance with appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC)

🤖 Model Comparison

Three different models were implemented and compared:
	•	Random Forest
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	XGBoost

We evaluated each model using multiple metrics and compared their performance to choose the best approach for fraud detection.

📊 Deliverables
	•	Well-documented Jupyter Notebook with clean, reproducible code
	•	Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
	•	Visualization of key insights (correlation matrix, class distribution, model performance charts)
	•	Business recommendations for practical fraud detection

🤝 Team Dynamics

The project was completed in collaboration with a colleague. Both of us contributed to data analysis, modeling, and result interpretation, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive approach to the challenge.

🛠 Tools & Skills
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, imblearn, XGBoost)
	•	Matplotlib and Seaborn for EDA and visualization
	•	Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
	•	Handling Class Imbalance (SMOTE)
	•	Model Selection, Training, and Evaluation

📚 Learning Outcomes
	•	Improved data preprocessing and EDA workflow
	•	Gained practical experience with class imbalance solutions
	•	Enhanced skills in model benchmarking, evaluation, and interpretation for binary classification

🚧 Challenges
	•	Severe class imbalance (fraud is <0.2% of all transactions)
	•	Choosing metrics that reflect business goals (recall/precision vs. overall accuracy)
	•	Avoiding overfitting while maximizing fraud detection rate

🌍 Contribution

This project aims to support safer online transactions by providing a robust and explainable approach to fraud detection. All code, methodology, and findings are openly shared for learning and further improvement.
