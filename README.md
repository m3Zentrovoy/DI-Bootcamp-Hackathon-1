# 🕵️‍♂️ Credit Card Fraud Detection – Hackathon Project

This project was created as part of a Data Science Hackathon to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world financial data. The main objective was to explore, preprocess, and model data in order to build an effective fraud detection system.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Analyze the “Credit Card Fraud Detection” dataset  
- Identify patterns and key features separating fraudulent and legitimate transactions  
- Develop and evaluate machine learning models to classify fraud accurately  
- Share business recommendations to reduce risk and improve detection

## 💡 Project Focus

We focused on classic fraud analytics tasks, including:
- Understanding the data distribution (class imbalance, feature analysis)
- Handling imbalanced classes (using SMOTE and resampling techniques)
- Feature selection and scaling
- Model benchmarking and selection (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
- Evaluating model performance with appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC)

## 🤖 Model Comparison

Three different models were implemented and compared:
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- XGBoost

We evaluated each model using multiple metrics and compared their performance to choose the best approach for fraud detection.

## 📊 Deliverables

- Well-documented Jupyter Notebook with clean, reproducible code
- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
- Visualization of key insights (correlation matrix, class distribution, model performance charts)
- Business recommendations for practical fraud detection

## 🤝 Team Dynamics

The project was completed in collaboration with a colleague. Both of us contributed to data analysis, modeling, and result interpretation, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive approach to the challenge.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, imblearn, XGBoost)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for EDA and visualization
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Handling Class Imbalance (SMOTE)
- Model Selection, Training, and Evaluation

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Improved data preprocessing and EDA workflow
- Gained practical experience with class imbalance solutions
- Enhanced skills in model benchmarking, evaluation, and interpretation for binary classification

## 🚧 Challenges

- Severe class imbalance (fraud is <0.2% of all transactions)
- Choosing metrics that reflect business goals (recall/precision vs. overall accuracy)
- Avoiding overfitting while maximizing fraud detection rate

## 🌍 Contribution

This project aims to support safer online transactions by providing a robust and explainable approach to fraud detection. All code, methodology, and findings are openly shared for learning and further improvement.
